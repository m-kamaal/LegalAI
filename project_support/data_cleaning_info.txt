1. What type of cleaning is required

a. Remove obvious noise

Drop page numbers, footers, headers, and artifacts like "---", “<unknown>”, etc.

Remove repetitive metadata (like "Page: 1, Label: TEXT").

b. Normalize text

Convert multiple spaces, tabs, and line breaks into a single space.

Standardize quotation marks, apostrophes, and hyphens.

Strip leading/trailing whitespace.

c. Merge fragmented lines

Merge text chunks belonging to the same logical paragraph (Docling often breaks sentences mid-way).

Preserve section headers (like "O R D E R" or "SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT") as separators.

d. Remove OCR artifacts

Clean isolated numerals like “1”, “2” which are actually page footers.

Handle encoding issues (“, ”, – → ", ", -).

e. Optional enrichment for RAG

Add structured metadata: {"page": 1, "section": "ORDER", "content": "..."}

Split long paragraphs into ~500 tokens for better embedding.

Lowercase if consistent with your retrieval approach (optional).
